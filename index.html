      <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel Okyere, and I'm a proud Ghanaian. I'm the youngest of six children in my family. In my free time, I enjoy reading, dancing, and exploring new developments in IT. I prefer to go by Emmanuel, which means 'God is with us' - a name that holds deep significance for me.
        I am studying Information Technology in BYU-IDAHO focusing on Website Developments and Software Programming. Growing up I have always loved to work in the Cyber Security field in order to protect and help others socail accounts from being intrigued.
